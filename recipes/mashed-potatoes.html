        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Introducing the greatest mashed potatoes of all time. Pro tip: ricer. Butter, butter, more butter. Thats it. 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes- (Russet/Idaho)</li>
            <li>1 cup Heavy Whipping cream or Half and Half</li>
            <li>1 stick of butter per 6 potatoes</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, halve, and boil potatoes until "Fork tender"(you can put a fork through them with no resistance)- but careful not to overboil- as soon as they are fork tender, they are done. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile heat cream and butter together. You may have to eyeball the amount of cream and add more once you add this mixture to potatoes</li>
            <li>Drain Potatoes, rice or mash, add heated cream and butter. Salt and pepper to taste!</li>
        </ol>
